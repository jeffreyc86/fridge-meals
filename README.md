## Demo

Watch the [Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/3f686e9cacc942d5926fe29d9e084c66)

## Technologies Used

`Fridge Meals` is built using `Ruby on Rails` and `SQLite`. Styling is done with all custom HTML and CSS. 

The app relies on ingredient and recipe information sourced from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/)'s API, as well as gifs to guide users through the application.

## Features

`Fridge Meals` allows users to discover recipes based on the ingredients they currently have available. Recipes suggestions will show the number of missing ingredients away a user is from completing the dish, as well as cooking and nutritional information.

### Signing Up / Logging In

Users are able to sign up and login. If any validations fail, errors are displayed back to the user. Upon a successful creation of an account or log in, the user is brought to their profile landing page.

On their landing page, a user will have access to their favorited recipes, their current ingredients, and recipe suggestions based on their ingredient inventory. Suggestions are categorized based on how many ingredients are missing from the dish.

### Updating Current Ingredients

Users are able to search for ingredients to their current inventory by name or filter by category. When they find the desired ingredient, the user specifies the quantity they have available to add it. Once added, the user's inventory and recipe suggestions will update accordingly.
